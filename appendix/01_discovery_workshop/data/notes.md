# Notes

_Notes from the audio recording of the workshop per question to supplement the Mentimenter responses_

## Q1: What apps, software, and data are you using in your daily work?

- Dietitians use a variety of apps to make their lives easier:
  - LifeSum
    - Food diary
    - Used for patients to see how much calories and protein they consume etc.
    - Now also has recipes etc.
  - Food Composition Data Base
  - Oviva
  - Debinet
  - Migros/Coop/Aldi Website or FCDB (used a lot!)
    - Explore specific food items in live sessions with the patient to answer their questions (e.g., “Is this product healthy?”)
    - Dietitian can then guide patients to “better” alternatives: E.g., Inform that Fat content is too high in X but lower in Y or protein content in Z is low.
    - Also helps the clients top directly see what the product looks like
    - E.g., compare fruit yoghurt vs. normal yoghurt, and how mug sugar fruit yoghurt has despite the healthy name
    - Used very pin pointed, eg for Dialyse Patient, Emmentaler cheese has less salt than others
- Dietitians are frustrated with the following features:
  - Slow loading times of websites, partially due to slow hospital internet

## Q2: What is great about them and what is still lacking?

- Expensive for patients
- Freeemium versions don’t cover important data points like micronutrients
- Complicated data formats (csv and not pdf)
- No sustainability data
  - Not a nutritional consultation focus point but is also considered by many today for public health and global health reasons
- Patients often complain that healthy eating is expensive —> adding price information and showing it doesn’t have to be could help patients

## Q3: What still is the most time-consuming or annoying activity that you engage in during a counselling session?

- Writing reports
  - Already have template but still takes a lot of time
- Evaluating and calculating food consumption diaries
- Having to switch between different websites to gather all the information needed
- Search bar very picky
  - E.G. Strawberry vs. Strawberries
- Processed foods often not available

## Q4: Which dietary factors are considered in your daily dietary consultations?

- Macro nutrients (7)
- Fibres (7)
- Meal timing/spacing (7)
- Food groups (6)
- Processed/unprocessed food (7)
- Energy density (4)
- Micro nutrients (4)
- Food additives (4)
- Nutri-Score (1): Not seen as relevant because it still requires some knowledge to properly interpret it, and because not used frequently in Switzerland

## Q5: Which added value do you expect from having food purchase data analyzed?

- Erkennung von Gewohnheiten, die bisher so nicht ersichtlich sind (7)
- Allgemeine Übersicht über das Einkaufsverhalten (5)
- Unterstützung beim Nährwertvergleich verschiedener Produkte (5)
- Other: Less effort(!) by not having to manually analyze food diaries, can easily export pdf
- Concern: “How can we differentiate if the person was shopping for multiple people or the office? How can you break down and calculate the consumption for one person?”
  - Suggestion: Log who ate what to remove products that were not bought for individual consumption
  - Has to be easy to use: “With my obesity patients; having to manually add or log data means 95% of patients won’t use the app. If you have to swipe that you only ate 2 out of 3 potatoes, that is already too annoying to do for patients. Only the highly educated and motivated patients would do such effort.”
- Concern: “Patients should not feel spied upon!”
  - Suggestion: Use the app and information to together reflect, e.g., this week I ate a lot of cake and sweet drinks”

## Q6: When would you use digital food shopping data in your counseling sessions? For which patient group? When would you not use it?

- Younger patients
- Obesity
- Diabetes
- Intolerances / Allergies

## Q7: Which of the available food product information would you like to use to set personalised nutritional goals/recommendations?

- Nutrient content distribution (5)
- Ratios such as animal-to-plant protein ratio (5)
- Energy proportions such as total energy purchased per macronutrient group or food group (4)
- Proportion of highly / moderate / non-processed foods purchased (4)
- Ranking of most frequently bought products (4)
- Ranking of products with largest energy, carb, fat, salt, sugar, etc. (4)

## Q8: How would you translate medical goals to nutritional recommendations based on food purchase data?

- Suggest alternative products (independently or together)
- Comparison between Recommendation and Actual food consumption
- See timeline for more motivation, and also see why lost weight; because two weeks no … —> correlate…
- “Was sollte man immer im Kühlschrank haben für eine ausgewogene Ernährung?”
  - “Wenn es schnell gehen soll…”
  - “Das hält lange im Kühlschrank/Kühler”
  - “Rezepte vorschlagen, und was man schon zu Hause hat und nicht mehr einkaufen muss —> Food waste”
